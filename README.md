# 🛡️ Open Source Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Platform (OSCTIP)

## 🌐 Overview

**OSCTIP** is a next-generation **open-source threat intelligence platform** designed to **aggregate, correlate, enrich, and visualize cybersecurity threats** from multiple public sources and APIs. The goal is to create a **modular**, **scalable**, and **community-driven** platform that empowers **cybersecurity analysts, SOC teams, researchers**, and **small to mid-sized organizations** with **actionable threat intelligence**—without relying on expensive commercial solutions.

This platform aims to bridge the gap between open data and practical insights through AI-powered enrichment, threat graphing, and collaboration features.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Democratize Access to Threat Intelligence:** Provide a free and extensible solution for real-time threat intelligence analysis and visualization.
- **Enable Proactive Defense:** Equip users with AI-enhanced early warning systems for threat detection and forecasting.
- **Foster a Security Research Community:** Allow collaboration and shared knowledge through open reporting, discussion, and plugin contributions.
- **Provide a Scalable, Modular Framework:** Built to grow with new threats, data sources, and research.
